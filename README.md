A molecule is made of two or more atoms, where each atom can occur more than once. An atom is represented by an atomic symbol consisting of a single uppercase letter or an uppercase letter followed by a lowercase letter (e.g. H, O, Fl, Na). 

An atom also has an atomic number that represents the number of protons in that atom. For example, the chlorine atom (Cl) has an atomic number of 17, which means it has 17 protons.

* A molecular formula is a non-empty sequence of atomic symbols (e.g. KBr, CO, LiCl). 
* A molecular formula can consist of a single atom (e.g. H) or a single atom repeated (e.g. O3)
